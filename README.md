# Module 3 Final Project

This project consisted of developing and analyzing various models that predict whether a SyriaTel customer will churn or not based on a number of features within a dataset. The following items help to direct one to different aspects of the project. 

-[Jupyter Notebook](student.ipynb): A walkthrough on the the OSEMiN Data Science Process that was used in order to assess whether a SyriaTel customer will churn or not. 

-[Blog Post](https://kahmadi94.medium.com/flatiron-data-science-module-3-project-8d2b99af9305): A blog post that discusses the hyperparameter tuning and pruning process of a Decision Tree Model. 

-[Presentation](presentation.pdf): A non-technical presentation that outlines the insights gained from implementing the OSEMiN Data Science Process on this specific problem. 

-[Video Walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wqd3nMuP9Vlt3TYGOdV2CsXCnWzayZHC/view?usp=sharing): A video that walksthrough the presentation of the insights gained from this work.
